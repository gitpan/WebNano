        <h1>Why WebNano</h1>

There are some common parts of many web applications, things like a login page,
a comment box, an email confirmation mechanism, a generic
CRUD page - all of them are quite well defined and one can think that
it should not be too
difficult to abstract them away into libraries.  And yet, every time you start a
web application you need to write that boring comment box again and
again.  Why there are so few of such libraries?  Why writing them is so hard?
There are more and less important reasons - but there are many of them and I
guess that eventually most of such application components projects die the
death of a thousand cuts.  Some of those problems can be solved and I believe
that solving them would make a difference. WebNano is my attempt at doing that.
<p>
Probably the most popular Perl web framework is Catalyst now, it is also the
web framework I know the best - this is why I choose it as the point of reference
for the analysis below. 

<h2>Controllers in request scope</h2>

Five years ago I was staring at the first Catalyst examples and I had this
foggy intuition that there is something not quite optimal there.  The essence
of object oriented programming is that the most accessed data is made available
to all methods in a class without
explicitly passing them via parameters.  But the examples always started with
<code>my ( $self, $c, ... ) = @_</code>, not very DRY.  The <code>$c</code>
parameter was dragged everywhere as if it was plain old procedural programming.
<p> 
At some point I <a
    href="http://perlalchemy.blogspot.com/2009/10/catalystcomponentinstancepercontext.html">
    counted how often methods from the manual use the controller object versus
    how often they use the context object which contains the request data</a> -
the result was 117 and 38 respectively.  Many people commented that their code
often uses the controller object.  It's hard to comment on this until the code
is made public, my own experience was very close to that show by the manual,
but this disproportion is only an illustration.  The question is not
about switching $c with $self. The question is why the
request data, which undeniably is in the centre of the computation carried on
in controllers, has to be passed around via parameters just like in plain old
procedural code instead of being made object data freely available to all
methods?
<p>
My curiosity about this was never answered in any informative way until about
year ago I finally got a reply in private communication from some members of
the core team - they want the controller object to be mostly immutable, and
that of course would not be possible if one of it's attributed contained data
changing with each new request.  Immutable objects are a good design choice and
I accepted this answer but later I though: Wait a minute - what if we recreated
the controller object anew with each request?  Then it could hold the request
data and still be immutable for his whole life time. Catalyst controllers 
are created at the starup time, together with all the other application
components (models and views) and changing that does not seem feasible - that's
why I decided to try my chances with writing a new web framework.
<p>
I have tried many Perl web frameworks but I
found only one more that uses controllers in request scope - it is a very
fundamental distinguishing feature of WebNano.  It's not only about reducing
the clutter of repeatable parameter passing - I believe that putting object into
their natural scope will fix a lot of the widely recognized <a
    href="http://jjnapiorkowski.vox.com/library/post/does-anyone-else-hate-the-stash.html">problems
with the Catalyst stash and data passed through it</a>.  In procedural
programming it is not a controversial rule to put your variable declarations
into the narrowest block that encompasses it's usage - the same should be true
for objects.  Sure using the same controller to serve multiple request is a bit
faster then recreating it each time - but that gain is not that big -
<a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/7c61aa08-d810-11df-8503-f91d06264d1f">Object::Tiny
on one of the tester machines could create 714286 object per second</a> and even
Moose - the slowest framework tested there can create more then a 10000 objects
per second.  Eliminating a few of such operations, in most circumstances, is not
worth compromising on the architecture.

By the way I also tested these theoretical estimations with more
down to earth <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">ab</a>
benchmarks for a trivial application serving just one page -
WebNano came out as the fastest framework tested.  This is
still not very realistic test - but should be enough to show
that the cost introduced by this design choice does not need to be big.


<h2>Decoupling</h2>

The reason why WebNano is the fastest framework is probably that it just does
not do much.  WebNano is really small, in it's 'lib' directory it currently has
just 240 lines of code (as reported by <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/">sloccount</a>)
and <a href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/?module=WebNano;perl=latest">minimal
dependencies</a>.  There are CPAN libraries covering all corners of web
application programming - what the framework needs to do is provide a basic
structure and get out of the way.
<p>
Catalyst started the process of decoupling the web framework from the other
parts of the application, with Catalyst you can use any persistence layer for
the model and any templating library for the view.  The problem is that the
<code>model</code> and <code>view</code> methods in Catalyst become rather empty
- there is no common behaviour among the various libraries - so all these
methods do is finding the model or view by it's name.  For WebNano I decided
that <code>->Something</code> is shorter and not less informative then
<code>->model('Something')</code> - and I got rid of these methods.
<p>
The other thing that I decided not to add to WebNano is initialization of
components.  Component initialization is a generic task and it can be done in
a similar way for all kinds of programs and the library that does that job does
not need to know anything about the web stuff.  At CPAN there are such
libraries.  For my limited experiments <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-SimpleConfig/">MooseX::SimpleConfig</a>
was very convenient, for more complex needs <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bread-Board/">Bread::Board</a> seems like
a good choice.  This initialization layer needs to know how to create all the
objects used by the application - but you don't need any kind of WebNano adapter
for them.

<h2>Localized dispatching</h2>

Out of the box WebNano supports only very simple
dispatching model - this can be enough because this default dispatching is
so easy to extend and override on per controller basis.  Dispatching is about
what subroutine is called and with what arguments - this is strongly tied to
the subroutines themselves.  This is why I don't believe in external
dispatchers where you configure all the dispatching for the application in one
place.  The dispatching might be in one place - but all practical changes need
to be done in two.
<p>
Writing a dispatcher is not hard - it becomes hard and
complex when you try to write a dispatching model that would work for every
possible application.  I prefer to write a simple dispatcher covering only the
most popular dispatching scenarios - and let the users of my framework write
their own specialized dispatching code for their specialized controllers. With
WebNano this is possible because these specialized dispatchers don't interfere
with each other.
<p>
I also believe that this will make the controller classes more encapsulated
- thus facilitating building libraries of application controllers.

<h2>Granularity</h2>

I like the way Catalyst structures your web related code into controller
classes - this is a step forward from the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/CGI-Application-4.31/lib/CGI/Application.pm">CGI::Application</a>
way of packing everything into one class.  I don't have any hard data to
support that - but the granularity of packing a few related pages into one
controller class feels just about right.  It gives room for expansion by adding
new classes and dividing existing ones - and it also does not clutter the
application code with too many nearly empty classes.  This is a very important
feature and in WebNano I copied this.

<h2>Experiments with inheritance and overriding</h2>

One of the WebNano tests is an application that a subclass of the main test
app.  It passes all the original tests and could be completely empty if I did
not want to test the overriding of the inherited parts.  I have seen many times
a need for such behaviour, from 'branding' websites, through SAAS to reusable
intranet tools - most of the time this was solved by copying the code.
Inheritance has it's problems but it would fit well this ad-hoc reuse and it is
still better then 'cut and paste' programming.  The key point here is that you
need to override much more than just methods.  The experiment I am doing with
WebNano is about overriding application parts: controllers, templates and
configuration, and independently at the level of individual controllers once
again overriding it's templates, plus of course the standard OO way of method
overriding.

<p>
I think with this type of inheritance it would be more
natural to publish applications to CPAN, because they could be operational
without any installation.  A user could run them directly from @INC and only
later override the configuration or templates as needed.

<h2>Universality</h2> 
In the most common case a web application serving a request needs to: fetch
data from the database, do some computation over this data and render a
template with the computed values.  Doing those tasks typically takes over 99%
of the overall time spent serving a request. The 1% of time spent in the
application framework processing does not matter much and reducing it further
would not result in any noticeable speed increase of the whole application.
Yet there might be some rare cases where the application needs to serve for
example small JASON data chunks from a memory cache - even when this is a small
and simple part of the application - if it generates enough volume - then the
speed of the framework suddenly becomes important. Would you code that part in
PHP?
<p>
It is well known that using Moose generates some significant startup overhead.
For web applications running in persistent environments - this does not matter
much because that overhead is amortized over many requests, but if you run your
application as CGI - this suddenly becomes important.  I was very tempted to
use Moose in WebNano - but even if CGI is perceived so passe now - it is still
the easiest way to deploy web applications and also one that has the most
widespread support from hosting companies.  Fortunately using MooseX::NonMoose
it is very easy to treat any hash based object classes as base classes for
Moose based code, so using WebNano does not mean that you need to stick to the
simplistic Object Oriented Framework it uses.
<p>
The plan is to make WebNano small, but universal, then make extensions that
will be more powerful and more restricted. I think it is important that the
base platform can be used in all kinds of circumstances.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
It is early to say if WebNano will live to the promise of facilitating the
development of web application components.  There is a first component at CPAN:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WebNano-Controller-CRUD/">WebNano::Controller::CRUD</a>.
It still bears the label 'experimental' - but I used it in <a
href="https://github.com/zby/Nblog">Nblog</a>.  When I compare it to my
first similar product <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~wreis/Catalyst-Example-InstantCRUD-0.037/lib/Catalyst/Example/Controller/InstantCRUD.pm">Catalyst::Example::Controller::InstantCRUD</a>,
there aren't many differences. As predictable the methods have one less parameter
(<code>$c</code>), and I think it's inheritable templates are
nice at deployment - you don't need to write your own templates to see it working,
later you can easily override the defaults.  There is a bit more dispatching
code - but thanks to that the result object is being retrieved from the model in
only one place.  In Catalyst this could also be done now by using the chained
dispatching.  In the 
<a href="https://github.com/zby/WebNano/tree/master/examples/DvdDatabase/lib/DvdDatabase/Controller/">examples directory</a>
there are four variations on this CRUD theme - I am still not decided about 
what is the optimal one.
<p>
The surprising thing when
converting Nblog from Catalyst to WebNano was how little I missed the rich
Catalyst features, even though WebNano has still so little code.  I think it is
a promising start.

<p>
Recently I discovered that many of my design choices are echoed in the
publications by the Google testing guru <a
href="http://misko.hevery.com/">Miško Hevery</a>.  My point of departure
for the considerations above were general rules - like decoupling,
encapsulation etc - his concern is testability - but the <a
href="http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/21/where-have-all-the-singletons-gone/">resulting
design</a> is remarkably similar.  There is a lot of good articles at his
blog, some were similar to <a
href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/04/15/managing-object-lifetimes/">what I
already had thought over</a>, <a
href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/04/08/how-to-do-everything-wrong-with-servlets/">others</a>
were completely new to me.  I recommend them all.
